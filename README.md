# Full-stack contacts app

- Contacts Book is a full-stack contacts app that allows you to add, edit and delete contacts. It also allows you to search for contacts by either name or phone number. It was a project to learn Golang and web-frameworks like Gin-gonic.

- I ultimately decided on Gin-gonic due to the availability of resources and simplicity of the guides. I also considered Fiber, which was known for it being similar to Express.js, but decided against it due to lack of familarity with the language. Also looked into Echo and Gorilla/Mux, but resources were limited and the latter seems to be more of router/library rather than a framework.

- Frontend: React.js, MUIv5 for component libraries and styling
- Backend: Golang + web-framework serving RESTful API: Gin-gonic
- Database: MongoDB
